# Topological Sort: 
Topological sorting is a special ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). 
It's a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge ùë¢ ‚Üí ùë£, vertex ùë¢ comes before vertex ùë£
in the ordering. In simpler terms, it arranges the vertices in a way that all dependencies are respected; 
if there's an edge from vertex A to vertex B, then A comes before B in the ordering.

# Topological Sort Order:
Topological sorting provides an order of vertices such that for every directed edge 
ùë¢ ‚Üí ùë£, vertex ùë¢ appears before ùë£ in the order.


# Algorithm for Topological Sorting
The algorithm typically used for topological sorting is based on Depth-First Search (DFS):

#DFS-based Approach:
Use DFS to traverse the graph.
Keep track of vertices after visiting all neighbors (recursively), which will give the topological order.

#Kahn's Algorithm:
Use an iterative approach involving a queue and indegree counts to achieve topological sorting.
Initialize indegree counts for all vertices, then iteratively remove vertices with zero indegree (starting with those that have no incoming edges).
